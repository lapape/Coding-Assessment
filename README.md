# Coding-Assessment

## Description

The purpose of this site is to display a quiz about javascript with scores stored in local storage that are displayed at the end of the quiz. Developing this site helped me learn about local storage, timers, and JSON.

## Installation

Utalize an updated browser to view the page: https://lapape.github.io/Coding-Assessment/

## Usage

Click the start button to begin the quiz. Each correct answer adds one point to the score, and each wrong answer takes away 10 seconds from the timer. At the end of the quiz, the player can store their score. After the quiz, all scores are displayed.
